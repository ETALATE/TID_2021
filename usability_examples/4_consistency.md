### Edith
The other day I had to check in an extra person on my Rejsekort in a pretty crowded bus. I very rarely use this feature. I went to the 'extra' check in stand and intuitively placed my card over the blue light as I usually do when using the normal check in stand. However, doing this I was only checking in one person. I wasn't aware of this..And apparently, to be able to check in an extra person I had to check out again at the check out stand, on the other side of the bus, return to the 'extra' check in stand, press the + button on the top and then place my Rejsekort over the blue light.
